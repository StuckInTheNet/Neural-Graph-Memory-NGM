Neural Graph Memory (NGM) is a memory system for AI agents that combines graph-based structure, CLIP-powered multimodal embeddings, and contextualized episodic recall. Designed for scenarios that demand long-range retrieval, temporal continuity, and associative linking across modalities.

## 🌐 Overview

NGM introduces a biologically-motivated memory system:

- **Graph-Structured Memory:** Nodes represent multimodal events (text, image, audio, timestamp); edges encode relationships such as temporal succession, semantic similarity, and co-location.
- **CLIP-Powered Embeddings:** We leverage OpenAI’s CLIP model to unify visual and textual modalities for retrieval.
- **Query-Aware Traversal:** Memory retrieval is implemented via graph traversal and embedding similarity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StuckInTheNet/neural-graph-memory.git
cd neural-graph-memory
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or in Colab: dependencies are installed automatically in the notebook.

### 3. Run the Demo Notebook

Open the notebook:

```bash
notebooks/NGM_Demo__.ipynb
```

Or run directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/StuckInTheNet/neural-graph-memory/blob/main/notebooks/NGM_Demo__.ipynb).

---

## 🧪 Benchmarking & Evaluation

Evaluate retrieval accuracy and traversal efficiency using:

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_ngm.py --data_dir=data --top_k=3
```

Sample output:

```
Recall@1: 0.76
Recall@3: 0.92
Graph traversal latency: 13.2ms
```

Optional visualization support coming soon.

## 📊 Data & Samples

Synthetic memory graphs are provided in the `data/` folder and include:

- `toy_graph.json`: multimodal memory nodes and relationships
- `synthetic_queries.json`: retrieval queries
- `annotations.json`: ground-truth relevance labels

Use `src/load_data.py` to load and manipulate them.

## 🖼️ Assets

All visual materials used in the notebook and paper are stored in `assets/`, including:

- Architecture diagrams
- Example memory stimuli (images)
- CLIP-compatible visuals
