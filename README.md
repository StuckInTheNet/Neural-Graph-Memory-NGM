A biologically inspired graph-structured memory architecture for long-term multimodal recall in AI agents.

Neural Graph Memory (NGM) enables structured memory storage and retrieval using node-based representations, associative links, and multimodal embeddings. Designed for agents that operate in complex environments, NGM supports episodic recall, long-range reasoning, and retrieval across time, space, and modality.
